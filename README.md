# Machine-Learning-Roadmap

Roadmap to learn AI by dBug Labs-

## 1. Absolute Basics of our Work

* Basic computer architecture:
  * [GPU vs CPU](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2009/12/16/whats-the-difference-between-a-cpu-and-a-gpu/)
  * [File Systems](https://wiki.microfocus.com/index.php/File_System_Primer)
* [Linux](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-linux-basics)
* [Containers - Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/)
* [Bash Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/bash)
* [Git-Introduction](https://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1/)


## 2. Data Science Stack
* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib and Seaborn
* scikit-learn
* SciPy

# 3. Machine Learning
* Try reading official documentation of various framework and libraries, learn to implement them the usual way and also from scratch.
* [Machine Learning - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (Note : this course is now divided into 3)
* [MIT 6.034](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/lecture-videos/)
* GeeksForGeeks Articles


# 4. Deep Learning
* [TensorFlow in Practice Specialization - Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?)
* [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/)
* [Stanford University's CS224n - NLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6)
* [DEEP LEARNING - Yann LeCun](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/)

## 5. Natural Language Processing

* [Natural Language Processing by National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing)
* [NLP course by Yandex Data School](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/nlp_course)


## 7. Deploying/Shipping Projects

### Feel free to use any of these frameworks, all are not required.

* [Full Stack Deep Learning](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/)
* [Full Stack Python](https://www.fullstackpython.com/)
* [TensorFlow: Data and Deployment Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-data-and-deployment?)
* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/)
* [Flask](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/index.htm)
* [Flutter](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flutter/index.htm)


# 8. Learn and gain information about AI through following -

* [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
* [Toward AI](https://towardsai.net/)
* [Reddit - Machine Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)
* [Reddit - Deep Learning](https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/)
* [Artificial Intelligence with Lex Fridman, MIT AI](https://open.spotify.com/show/2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL)




### Most important stuff around AI is that it is an ever evolving field and making a perfect roadmap is not possible,so make changes as you proceed in your ML/AI/DL journey . PRs are welcome.
